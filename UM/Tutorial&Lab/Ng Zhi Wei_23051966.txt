My name is Ng Zhi Wei with matrix number,23051966. I am
majoring in Data Science. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this
subject. This is because I heard from senior that this subject is hard.

I acquired A+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s  too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get B+ for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will try to practice more questions. Wish me luck!!!

I think I did well in this course. I am happy with my performance. I have laern think critically in solving the problem.
My target grade has changed to A. 
During the course, I did well in complete all the assignments on time
.However, i think I could do better in parti actively in group discussion.
